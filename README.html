<p>
	Pierrot is a stochastic, post-tonal music composer and set of composition tools.
	The composer, specifically the compose() function, generates a composition and a resultant midi file using stochastic processes in conjunction with materials and other parameters provided by the user.
</p> 
<p>	
	A user interface is provided by running pierrot.py.
	Alternatively, the composition tools, the same functions and classes used indirectly through the user interface, may be used directly by writing one's own script; example scripts are provided in the pierrot/examples subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
