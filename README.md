<h1>Pierrot</h1>

<p>Pierrot is an algorithmic, post-tonal music composer which aims to compose music coherent with user input of pitch-class sets, rhythms, instrumentation, and other such materials/parameters; the resultant composition is generated as a midi file. This project makes use of the Python packages <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mingus/", title="mingus">mingus</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pcsets/", title="pcsets">pcsets</a> and is dependent upon their installation. The program is run via pierrot.py.</p>
